# Placement Dating for Students

It is one of the SCORE 2021 project chosen for Software Engineering course. 

## Abstract

This project will create a matching service to connect placement students with potential employers. Using a “dating” service metaphor, the site will allow employers to post details of placements available and students to apply for placements. 

## Description

Placements with employers play a valuable role in the learning journey for software engineering and computing students. Placement students are paid a salary and benefit from support and mentoring towards working on live production projects. Different terminology is used in different countries. Placements are sometimes called “paid internships” or “work experience.”
